# Medical Image Segmentation – AI Club Project

This project implements a semantic segmentation pipeline using a patch-based feedforward neural network (FFNN) on grayscale medical scan images. Built as part of the Wake Forest AI Club, the model learns to classify the center pixel of 16×16 image patches and reconstructs full segmentation masks.

## Highlights
- Built an end-to-end image segmentation system using TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib
- Converted 256×256 medical scans into labeled 16×16 patches for center-pixel classification
- Achieved 38% accuracy improvement over baseline via training optimizations
- Reconstructed full-resolution segmentation masks from patch-level predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab (runtime)

## Files
- `ai_club_segmentation.py` or `.ipynb`: Full training pipeline (preprocessing, training, inference)
- `scans.npy`: Grayscale medical images (shape: N x 256 x 256)
- `labels.npy`: Corresponding segmentation masks (shape: N x 256 x 256)
- `project_instructions.pdf`: Original assignment specification from professor

## Sample Output
Sample predictions and training plots can be regenerated by running the notebook. Outputs include:
- Test image with predicted vs. ground truth mask
- Training and validation accuracy/loss graphs

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies (see optional `requirements.txt`)  
3. Run `ai_club_segmentation.py` or open the `.ipynb` notebook in Colab  
4. Make sure `labels.npy` and `scans.npy` are in the same directory  

```bash
python ai_club_segmentation.py
